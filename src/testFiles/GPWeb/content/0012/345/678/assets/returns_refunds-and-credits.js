If the refund is applied to your credit card, your credit card company may take up to 10 additional business days to post the refund to your account.<p><\/p>If you pay using both a gift card and a credit card, and later decide to return your purchase, the amounts are credited differently depending on whether you return all or part of the original purchase total. For example, if you split a $100 total between a gift card and a credit card, we would refund half the return to the credit card, and half to a new gift card we would send you. But if you returned only one item with a cost of $60, we would refund $50 of that to your credit card and $10 to a new gift card. And if you returned the $40 item, the entire refund would go to the credit card.<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"
